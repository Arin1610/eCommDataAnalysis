## Description  

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of customer segmentation using clustering techniques on customer profile and transaction data. The project is divided into three main tasks:  

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights  
- **Objective**: Perform EDA to uncover patterns and trends in the data.  
- **Deliverables**:  
  - Python code for EDA.  
  - A report summarizing at least 5 actionable business insights.  

### Task 2: Lookalike Model  
- **Objective**: Develop a Lookalike Model to recommend 3 similar customers for a given CustomerID based on their profiles and transactions.  
- **Deliverables**:  
  - Recommendations in `Lookalike.csv` for CustomerID C0001 - C0020.  
  - Python code for the model.  

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering  
- **Objective**: Conduct customer segmentation using clustering techniques.  
- **Deliverables**:  
  - A report summarizing the clustering results, including the number of clusters formed, DB Index value, and other metrics.  
  - Python code for clustering analysis.  

## Files Included  
- **EDA_Analysis.ipynb**: Code for EDA.  
- **Business_Insights.pdf**: Insights derived from EDA.  
- **Lookalike_Model.py**: Code for the Lookalike Model.  
- **Lookalike.csv**: Recommendations from Task 2.  
- **Customer_Segmentation_Report.pdf**: Clustering results.  
- **Clustering_Analysis.py**: Code for clustering analysis.
